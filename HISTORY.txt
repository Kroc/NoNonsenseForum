v26     22.FEB.15
*       Fixed problems with transliteration when on PHP5.4 without all the necessary libs in place
*       Stick and Unstick thread buttons when logged in as the Admin (the Admin is now the first person listed in mods.txt)
        NOTE: the lock and unlock links have been changed into buttons, make sure to update custom translations / CSS!
*       Windows 8 snap-view
*       Apache version is now verified (1&1 are still using v1.3!),
        also the Apache identifier "NOYB" (None Of Your Business) is skipped
*       Updated to DOMTemplate v17, fix for major bug corrupting querystrings and attributes,
        with thanks to Bruno Héridet for narrowing down and Zegnat for suggesting a fix
*       Fix for `@name` corrupting posts when HTAccess off, with thanks to Stephen Taylor
*       Corrupted posts will now be removed entirely when deleted instead of being blanked first
        (this may break some permalinks if deleting a corrupted post before the last page)
*       Delete and Append buttons have new icons to look less like voting buttons!
*       Fixed sitemap.xml using the wrong path when the forum is in a sub-folder
*       Fixed favicon missing when the forum is in a sub-folder
*       Moved some functions into a new "utf-8 safe" library for sanitising input / output
        -       NOTE: Very incomplete. Will improve over multiple releases
        -       Declared UTF-8 in the content-type header to prevent UTF-7 attacks
        -       a `safeTrim` function to trim all kinds of whitespace outside of TAB / SPACE / CRLF
        -       the superglobals (`$_GET` / `$_POST` &c.) are preprocessed with `stripslashes`, `safeTrim` & UTF-8 safety
        -       `safeGet` was removed in favour of `mb_substr` use as superglobal preprocessing covers the rest

v25     26.FEB.13
*       Fixed iOS rotation / zooming with the help of TCB
*       Fixed appends double-encoding HTML, with thanks to Stephen Taylor
*       Fixed unable to delete corrupted posts unless signed in
        NOTE: the class `nnf_error` was added to `<article class="nnf_post nnf_op">` in "delete.html"
*       Updated to DOMTemplate v16, much better handling of HTML / XML

v24     10.JAN.13
*       Dynamic HTML titles (index / thread pages), the date format ('dd/mm/yyyy') and other strings that were previously
        not translatable (since v19) are now translatable. This causes a number of changes in theme configuration:
        -       These strings are now stored in `$LANG['']` (the default language) in 'theme.php' instead of, as before,
                as constants in 'theme.config.default.php', therefore it is advised that you make a new 'theme.config.php'
                file by making a copy of the updated 'theme.config.default.php' file
        -       If you've modified the 'theme.php' file at all, you should update to the new version
        -       If you've written any translations, you will need to update those with the new set of strings at the top
                of 'lang.example.php'
*       Fixed duplicate ID `nnf_post`, with thanks to Bruno Héridet
        NOTE: `<article id="nnf_post" class="...` was changed to `<article class="nnf_post ...` in "append.html",
        "delete.html" and "thread.html". No changes required in the CSS.
*       Fixed critical typo in "lang.example.php" with thanks to "gardener"
*       Pages were not working on sub-forums, with thanks to Steve Bir
*       Removed extra space that was being added around code blocks

v23     24.DEC.12
*       Duplicate appends are now ignored
*       Title lines (":: ...") within posts now link to themselves, allowing external links directly to title lines
*       Fixed mods not being able to reply to locked threads
*       Improved denying access to NNF's folders and a "cgi-bin" folder no longer shows as a sub-forum
*       `$1` no longer being stripped from code spans / blocks, with thanks to Zegnat
*       `THEME_APPEND` has been removed, `THEME_APPENDED` is a plain-text (but markup allowed) replacement.
        This is necessary to ensure that title links are always unique when appending text to a post.
        This also means that the class `nnf_appended` is gone, old appended dividers won't be styled
*       "@user" names in posts are now classed ("nnf_mod") if the user is a moderator
*       Fixed inconsistencies with 'nnf_mod' and changed class 'sticky' to 'nnf_sticky'
*       Canonical URL `<link>` added to "index.html" / "thread.html" / "markup.html" and "privacy.html"
*       Sign-in is now a button instead of a link, this mostly paves the way for future improvements
*       Page numbers now shown at the top when on portrait mobile display
*       External links now use `rel="nofollow external"`, internal links do not use `nofollow`, with thanks to Zegnat
*       Title field is now spellchecked
*       Simplified the `url` function, note that this will affect your 'theme.php', just drop the first parameter

v22     13.OCT.12
*       Posts with invalid HTML now display a message, rather than dumping PHP errors
*       RSS URL in the HTML meta was wrong and had been for some time!
*       Massively improved transliteration from thread title to filename / URL; if using PHP5.4 with the 'intl' extension
        enabled, even Greek / Hebrew / Arabic / Japanese / Chinese (and more) will be transliterated into ASCII! 
*       Fixed italics appearing in the middle of URLs
*       Fixed bug with URL parsing with subdomains
*       Improved code markup "`...`" parsing
*       Improved templating speed, with thanks to Sani
*       Improved .htaccess compatibility with Mac OS, with thanks to Zegnat
*       Fixed lock button accidentally showing sometimes, with thanks to Paul M.

v21     08.JUL.12
*       Support for running without HTAccess:
        NoNonsenseForum will now auto-detect if '.htaccess' is missing or disabled and fall back to running without,
        automatically rewriting URLs to full form. Note that to be able to use NNF without HTAccess,
        you will have to move the "users" folder to a private location, using the feature below
*       Added `FORUM_USERS` option to 'config.default.php' to set the location where the passwords are saved. you will need
        to change this option to run NoNonsense Forum without HTAccess. It can also be used to share the same users between
        multiple forums or even other compatible software
*       Added Windows 8 Metro pinned-site tile "metro-tile.default.png",
        you can override it by providing your own "metro-tile.png"
*       `METRO_COLOUR` theme option to set the Metro tile colour on Windows 8 and the pinned-site colour on Desktop IE

v20     19.JUN.12
*       HiDPI / Retina display graphics
*       Massively improved error messages
*       Using a blockquote directly within blockquote fixed
*       Forum title truncated "…" if too long for screen size
*       Google search and IE9 metadata was moved out of core and into 'theme.php'
*       Typo in 'lang.example.php' that was causing errors when making translations
*       Custom logo option had been broken for a long time, sorry!

v19     03.MAY.12
*       Translation support
        -       Themes can provide their own translations and admins can add more themselves easily
                (no translations are provided with NNF, yet, this release just adds support)
        -       Browser language is auto-detected, user can select one, and a default can be set by the admin
        -       Markup.txt removed, moved to a themed / translatable page
        -       Privacy policy added (also translatable)
        -       Translations for 'about.html' can be provided with 'about_en.html' where 'en' is the language code
        -       Page titles on index / thread / append & delete cannot be translated just yet,
                support for this will be added in a later release
*       Fixed a long-standing bug that caused page boundaries (i.e. posts per page) to be incorrectly calculated
*       Fixed incompaitbility with Windows servers involving page numbers in URLs. '+' is now used instead of ':'
*       Fixed bug with stickies not showing if no non-sticky threads exist (with thanks to "Sani")
*       Moved `theme_pageList` from 'theme.config.default.php' and into a new 'theme.php' for storing the theme functions;
        this allows each theme to use different types of lists without 'theme.config.php' having to be updated all the time
*       Page numbers are now validated / bounded
*       Current page number more visible
*       Added INSTALL.txt
*       If a mod / member, threads in locked forums no longer show warning message
        (similar to the change in v18 that removed the same warning from index pages)

v18     05.MAR.12
*       'delete.html' had been missing for some time!
*       The sticky-thread icon had been missing for an equally long time
*       Mods and member's list not showing in the footer
*       Sub-forum lock icon positioning fixed

*       CSS fixes for IE6/7/8, iOS and Kindle

v15     25.JAN.12
*       The greyscale theme's logo was being templated in the wrong file,
        since it's theme-specific, it has been moved to 'theme.config.default.php'
*       Added page next / previous links
        NOTE: if you have already created a 'theme.config.php' file, it is recommended to
        create a fresh copy from 'theme.config.default.php' for the above two changes
*       "User X added on date Y" text won't copy/paste so quotes can be cleaner
*       Fixed bug in v14 that stopped replies from working

v14     23.JAN.12

*       Added XML namespace support to `DOMTemplate`
*       Modified `DOMTemplateRepeater` to append items after the previous,

*       Complete theming overhaul. The PHP logic and HTML are now separated using this methodology:
        http://camendesign.com/dom_templating allowing admins to modify the HTML easily.

        (anybody can just access the "index.xml" file to view posts); will leave this feature

v8      06.DEC.11
*       Access control: Major new feature! You can lock forums and limit posting / access to certain users:
        (Members can be specified in a 'members.txt' file)

v4      19.AUG.11
